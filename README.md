# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [SpriteKit Basics: Nodes][published url]
## Instructor: [James Tyner][instructor url]


SpriteKit is Apple's 2D game engineâ€”a rendering engine built on top of OpenGL. It was introduced with iOS 7, and each subsequent release has brought great additions to the framework. With the use of textured sprites, a built-in physics engine, and the very powerful SKAction class, you can very quickly build functional 2D games.

SpriteKit has built-in editors for scenes and particles, a camera node since the release of iOS9, and built-in support for tilesets since the release of iOS 10. With these new additions, SpriteKit is quickly becoming a powerhouse for creating 2D games.
